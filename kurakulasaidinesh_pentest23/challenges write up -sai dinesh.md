The objective of the challenge is to obtain the flag by completing a series of challenges which gives us a piece of the flag . On decompiling the apk file is found a recruitment folder and after checking the file I found the main activity file and in the same folder I found the above code which is a program to check if our flag is correct or not and upon analyzing the code I found the following about the flag 

It checks if the input string str starts with the prefix "p3nt35t{".

It checks if the length of the input string is exactly 40 characters.

It checks if the last character of the string (reversed) is '}'.

It checks if the substring from the 9th character to the end (excluding the first 8 characters) starts with "droid" in a case-insensitive manner.

It checks if the character at the 14th position of the string is '_'.

If any of these checks fail, the method returns false.

If all the above checks pass, it checks if the substring from the 15th to the 20th character of the input string (excluding the 20th character) is equal (ignoring leading and trailing whitespaces) to the Base64-decoded string "RW5pZ21hCg", and if the 21st character of the string is '_'. If this check fails, the method returns false.

If the above check passes, it further checks if the substring from the 14th to the 19th character of the reversed input string (excluding the 19th character) is equal (ignoring leading and trailing whitespaces) to the Base64-decoded string "ZG4zY3NA", and if the 20th character of the string is '_'. If this check fails, the method returns false.

If all the previous checks pass, it checks if the input string starts with "21wsmkla10o" at position 28. If this check fails, the method returns false.

If all of the checks mentioned above pass, the method returns true, indicating that the input string meets all the specified criteria

On following the above we can reverse engineer the flag and the flag I obtain is

Flag=p3nt35t{droid_@sc3nd_Enigma_21wsmkla10o}  


# 2) **M4pp1ng_c4t**


The objective of this challenge is to Identify the number of open services and the Harry's nc port running behind the system ip <43.205.129.227>

So I had copied the ip and ran a nmap scan on the ip and I after the scan we get the results which is 3 open ports and the harry’s nc port is 969 so on following the format for the flag the flag we obtain is

Flag=p3nt35t{3_969}

For this challenge we need to enter  a valid 6 digit otp to get the flag and we get invalid if we enter a wrong otp. To begin I started my looking at the cookies and found a interesting cookie “TVJCVzZaREZFQkJHQzQzRkdNWkE=” and on noticing the = sign at the end I thought is was a base64 encoded string so on decoding it I got “MRBW6ZDFEBBGC43FGMZA” it seemed like a random array of letters but using a totp generator with this as a secret key we get a totp and upon entering the totp and pressing we get token valid and the flag

Flag=p3nt35t{T1m3_Tr4v3l3r_T0k3n}

4)Find me



For this challenge we need to uncover the hidden strings in a apk file to find the flag.i approached this challenge first by using the strings cmd in my terminal but since its taking too long to run so I decided to search manually and looking in the resources I found a file named findme.so on looking into it I found the  flag.

Flag= p3nt35t{y0u_f0uNd_$tr!ng5.xm1_f!13}
